            <h1>Hello brothers of Detroit #2</h1>
            <p>Our payment portal is currently down.</p>
            <p>The Grand Lodge of Michigan is switching over between online payment processors and as such we are unable to take online payments at this time.</p>
            <p>Once we are able to take online dues payments this site will be updated to redirect to the new processor.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your understanding, please direct any questions and payments to secretary Pat at <a href="mailto:detroit2pm2016@gmail.com">detroit2pm2016@gmail.com</a></p>
